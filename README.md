Here is my version of the Finding Collinear Points By Using Merge-Sort (which is a coding challenge of Coursera Algorithm course from princeton). This version will provide the correct solution and able to handle some errors throwing requirements correctly. Feel free to use to enhance your learning experience. Thanks
